# m68k-atari-dev
A development system providing cross compiling and remote debugging for Atari TOS computers.

## Key features:
* Standard C and C++ libraries using newlib [m68k-atari-elf](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=newlib-cygwin.git;a=commit;h=cac47030fb003570295582606f158609f626347f) target.
* Elf to prg converter that keeps binary segments unchanged for symbol compatibility.
* A gdbserver specifically written from the ground up for Atari TOS computers.
* Editing, building and debugging can all be integrated in Visual Studio Code.

## Setup for Linux (Recommended! Tested on Ubuntu):
1. Open a terminal.
2. Enter: `sudo apt update`
3. Enter: `sudo apt install build-essential texinfo flex bison libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev gdb-multiarch`
4. Enter: `git clone https://github.com/hildenborg/m68k-atari-dev.git` to download m68k-atari-dev.
5. Enter: `cd m68k-atari-elf`
6. Enter: `./build.sh`
   
Depending on your system, the last line may take minutes or hours.  
All binaries will be installed in (UserHome)/toolchain/m68k-atari-elf.  

## Setup for Macos (debugging currently not supported):
1. Open a terminal.
2. Enter: `xcode-select --install` to install all xcode command line tools.
3. Enter: `git clone https://github.com/hildenborg/m68k-atari-dev.git` to download m68k-atari-dev.
4. Enter: `cd m68k-atari-elf`
5. Enter: `./build.sh`
   
Depending on your system, the last line may take minutes or hours.  
All binaries will be installed in (UserHome)/toolchain/m68k-atari-elf.  

## Setup for Windows (not recently tested, expect problems):
1. Install msys and mingw by following instructions on [www.msys2.org](https://www.msys2.org/)
2. From start menu, start `MSYS2 UCRT64`.
3. Enter: `pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain cpio gmp-devel mpfr-devel mpc-devel git mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gdb-multiarch`
4. Enter: `git clone https://github.com/hildenborg/m68k-atari-dev.git` to download m68k-atari-dev.
5. Enter: `cd m68k-atari-elf`
6. Enter: `./build.sh`
   
Depending on your system, the last line may take minutes or hours.  
All binaries will be installed in (UserHome)/toolchain/m68k-atari-elf.  

## Examples:
There are a few examples in the [Extras](extras/README.md) folder.

## TOS specific C/C++ features:
Stack and heap settings are set in a way that should be compatible with mintlib.  
A portion of memory is reserved and shared between the heap and the stack.  
The heap starts at the bottom of the shared memory and the stack starts at the top, and they grow towards eachother.  
A safety check for memory allocations is done to make sure that memory is not allocated and overwriting the stack.  
The symbol: "_stksize" defines how much memory that is reserved for stack **and** heap using the following scheme:
1. If "_stksize" is undefined, then all available memory is reserved.
2. If `int _stksize = SIZE;` is defined anywhere in the code, then "SIZE" is used in this way:
   * SIZE == 0: then MINKEEP (64KB) memory is reserved.
   * SIZE == 1: then 1/4 of all memory is reserved.
   * SIZE == 2: then 2/4 of all memory is reserved.
   * SIZE == 3: then 3/4 of all memory is reserved.
   * SIZE >= 4: then SIZE memory is reserved.
   * SIZE == -1, then all available memory is reserved (for mintlib compatibillity).
   * SIZE < -1, then -SIZE memory is reserved (for mintlib compatibillity).

## Elf to prg technical:
Conversion from elf to prg is done in two separate steps: link time and post link time.  
Link time is done through a link script included in newlib, installed in "toolchain/m68k-atari-elf/m68k-atari-elf/lib/atari-tos.ld".  
Post link time is done by the binary "m68k-atari-elf-prg" which is built from the sources in "elf-prg".  
The link script will:  
Collect all relevant sections and bunch them together in the three segments atari prg files support: ".text", ".data" and ".bss".  
The ".text" segment will start at address 0 and the ".data" and ".bss" segments will follow accordingly.  
A segment called ".prgheader" containing all correct data will be included in the elf file.  
The "m68k-atari-elf-prg" will:  
Extract ".prgheader", ".text", ".data" and ".bss" in that order and add a fixup table for relocation data.  
**The main benefit of doing it in two steps is that the elf file and prg file will be _binary address compatible_.**  
Which means that we can use the elf file for symbol lookup in gdb.  

## Gdbserver example usage:
Connect your atari to your pc using a serial to usb adapter.  
Copy the file "toolchain/m68k-atari-elf/bin/gdbsrv.ttp" and the program you want to debug to your Atari computer.  
On your atari, start "gdbsrv.ttp" and enter `--multi [name of prg to debug]`.  
In your pc terminal, enter: `gdb-multiarch [name of elf file]`.  
In gdb, enter: `target remote [pc serial port]`  
You can now remotely debug your atari code with full symbols.  
This can also be done using Visual Studio Code directly in source code, look at the "vscode_hatari" in "extras" for example of this.  
The "gdbsrv.ttp" program can be exited by pressing F4.
